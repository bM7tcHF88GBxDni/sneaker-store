# Sneaker Store
- Creating an eCommerce site focused on selling the latest sneakers, initial spec:
```c#
Your solution should reflect the mockups supplied.
 - We have supplied a JSON file with 24 items on it.
 - When the user arrives at the page, the user should see 24 items in a row of 4 items for Desktop and large breakpoints and 2
items for Mobile and small breakpoints. ✔️
 - When the user hovers on an item, an overlay should be displayed on top of the item. The overlay should contain all the product
information included in the JSON file. ✔️
 - When the user clicks on an item, it should open the product page based on the provided url in a new tab. ✔️
 - Any external data is in JSON file supplied. ✔️
 - We are expecting you to use React. ✔️
 - We are expecting to use the data (json) through a normal ES6 import ✔️
 - We are expecting you to use Javascript even if you’re familiar with Typescript. ✔️
 - Your solution should work nicely on mobile and desktop viewports. ✔️
Side notes
 - You may use any JS libraries or frameworks you wish. ✔️
 - You can use CSS, SASS, LESS, Styled components, Fela, or any other styling you like. ✔️
 - We like to build mobile-first, so please keep this consideration in mind. ✔️
 - Demonstrate that you can use the latest functionality available in React to achieve what you need. ✔️
Nice to haves
 - Add documentation and/or instructions if required. ✔️
 - Use React Hooks (useState, useEffect) if necessary. ✔️
 - Set up and write unit tests.
 - Use CSS animations/transitions on image to add a bit of design flare. ✔️
 - Use a CSS design pattern (BEM, Smaccs, etc). ✔️
```
