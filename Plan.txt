    An overlay should be displayed on top of the item. The overlay should contain all the product information included in the JSON file.
    On mobile, the overlay has a link/button to the full product page
    When the user clicks on the rest of the item, the overlay recedes back to show the original item view

Desktop. Design
Display 4 items per row, 24 items in total
When the user hovers on an item, an overlay should be displayed on top of the item. The overlay should contain all the product information included in the JSON file.
